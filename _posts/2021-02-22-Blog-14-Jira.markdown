      the Google sheets. In Sheets we have access to the other google applications and unquine features Google offices, the mail 
      feature we will use in Google sheet is the Mail Merge extension

<h1>How Google Mail Merge work</h1>
      You make a Gmail draft format with stand ins for data from a Google Sheets spreadsheet. A placeholder tag is represented by each column heading in a sheet. The script transmits each placeholder's information from the spreadsheet to the location of the appropriate replacement tag in your email document.

<h1>Step 1: Copy spread sheet </h1>

<h1>Step 2: Create an email template </h1>
- Create a google email to use as template, if you would like to call out the data from the mail merge sheet, we have to label the email correctly with the columns. For example {{FirstName}}, {{LastName}}, {{Date}} and more. The double brackets capture the column needs in the from the sheet.

- Once the draft is complete and the subject line an apocopate and save a draft or a templet.
