<h1>Enroll AMc without dep</h1>
Do not manually a Mac that is able to be enrolled via DEP. Always first try to DEP-enroll first, and then fall back to manual enrollment only as a last resort if DEP enrollment isn't working or DEP enrollment is available

<h1>Requirements</h1>
    A Mac that has not been turned on and set up yet (e.g. "factory fresh")
    OR a Mac that has been reset to factory configuration by performing a erase and reinstall of macOS in recovery mode
    OR a Mac that cannot be DEP'ed, because it is part of a merger or acquisition (skip to step #10)
    About 40 minutes
    A fast network connection (preferably hard-wired)
    Note: DEP enrollment isn't available in all countries. Check the Apple website for the most up-to-date list.


    Steps
    1.	Plug the Mac into power and Ethernet.
    2.	Turn on the Mac.
    3.	If the Mac is NOT factory-fresh from Apple (as indicated by booting up to a login screen instead of to the setup assistant), you'll need to erase and install macOS to restore it to factory defaults using one of the options below.

    Factory Fresh or Erase and install.

    4.	At the Welcome screen, select your country and click Continue.
    5.	Select any accessibility options the customer may need. Otherwise, click Not Now.
    
    6.	If you haven't hardwired an ethernet connection, select a Wi-Fi network

    7.	Now you should NOT see a Remote Management screen.
    8.	Click Continue.
    9.	Create the local account.
    â€¢	If you're setting up this Mac for a customer or NHO, use the customer's name and password.
    10.	Make sure the time zone is set to update automatically based on location.

    11.	You should see the Setting Up Your Mac waiting screen, followed soon by more Setup Assistant screens, and then the default macOS desktop and dock.
    12.	Open Safari and navigate to https://sccorp.jamfcloud.com/enroll/
    13.	Check LastPass for the latest JAMF login credentials
    14.	This will ask to download a CA Certificate, as well as, our MDM profile
    15.	Once downloaded please install both
    16.	Within a minute of logging in, you should see a message that says "Welcome to your new Mac" along with a progress indicator:

    If, for some reason, that does not appear but you're certain the Jamf profile is installed, run this command to manually invoke it: sudo jamf policy -event depnotifyandmunki

    While this message is being displayed, software and updates are being installed. The process should take no more than 20 minutes, depending on how many updates are required.
    17.	When the process is finished, you will see the login window with the customer account and the IT Admin account. Log in as the customer.
    18.	Go to System Preferences > Profiles > MDM SC-CORP Profile. If you see an Approve button there, click it to approve the MDM enrollment.
    19.	Join the Mac to Wi-Fi as you normally would.
    20.	When you log out, you may be prompted to enable FileVault. If so, enter the customer's password.
    21.	For newly imaged machines, we are now using Crypt for FileVault escrow instead of Jamf, so there is no longer any need to enable FileVault for the ITAdmin account.
    22.	Then go to System Preferences > Software Updates and install any pending software updates.
    23.	Once the updates have installed fully, and you've logged back in as the customer, go to Applications > Utilities > Terminal and run the command sudo managedsoftwareupdate --auto && sudo killall jamf; sudo jamf policy && sudo jamf recon
    24.	Once that command completes, shut down the Mac.
    The Mac is now ready to deploy to the customer.
