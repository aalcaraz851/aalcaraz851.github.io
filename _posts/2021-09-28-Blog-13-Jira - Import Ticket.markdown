This week I will be explianing how to use some features in Jira software.

<h1>JIRA</h1>
      Jira Software is part of a suite of solutions meant to assist teams of all sizes in managing their workloads. Jira was originally intended to be a bug and problem tracker. Jira, on the other hand, has matured into a strong task management application for various types of use cases, ranging from requirements and test case management to agile software development.

<h1>How to create a Jira Issue</h1>
      Jira can be used as a ticketing system to help companies keep track of issues, projects, and documentation.

      Keeping track of projects is one uneasy function you can use Jira for.

Buttt.

If we have multiple tickets  that we want to create there is a feature that helps create multiples tickets we use the Jira buclk create tool 
This a tool that grabs a .csv file and uses the data from the sheet to create muiltles fields for the ticket issue and others. Example − Summary, Assignee, Reporter, Priority, Description, Epic, “Windows”, or more.

<h1>Step 0:</h1>
When prparing your CSV you should have a heading row with a summary column. The first row is the heading row and represents the fields of the create issue page.
