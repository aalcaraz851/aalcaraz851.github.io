<h1>Manually applying Windows Update</h1>
Manually applying Windows Updates is a an important technique when applying a new OS version to a computer when a feature isn't working or when changing the OS version on an old Windows version. Checking for updates normally works but is some situations when creating your own install or ISO image finding the MSI can be flexible to your needs.

    2.	Visit the Microsoft Release Information page to determine the latest SSU & CU
     updates (Service Stack Update and Cumulative Update) for Windows according to the 
     installed OS version present on the customer device.
    (The latest updates will not be available via Windows Update but can be downloaded 
    from the Microsoft Update Catalog, Airwatch will not have the latest update available 
    until the updates are released to Windows Update, so Metrics definition is never the latest update)

    3.	Click on the link for the latest update, scroll down towards the bottom to find 
    the SSU KB-id then click the link for the Microsoft Update Catalog
    
    4.	Search for the updates (2, 1 Cumulative, 1 Service Stack Update) in the Update 
    Catalog, verify that you're downloading the update for the correct OS. (Client devices 
    are more than likely on x64, Windows 10 1903 & 1909 share the same updates.)
    Click the Download button, in the pop up window, click on the link to download the .msu 
    file (or right click & copy the link and message the link to the client)

    the UBR number of the OS.
    
    9.	Query the device from the console & re-sync the agent in the taskbar on 
    the device. (May take a few minutes to refresh in the console)
        
    10.	Confirm that the UBR is now compliant in the Console where you manage devices, check Device's status.

<h1>Summary: </h1>
The installation is quite simple, but obtaining the MSI can be difficult. Windows has multiple versions of Windows 10 that can be used to update your operating system. Finding this MSI is vital since it can assist you in making your own bootable image to modify a computer when creating any logic for Windows upgrades. When this procedure is automated, managing updates becomes easier.
