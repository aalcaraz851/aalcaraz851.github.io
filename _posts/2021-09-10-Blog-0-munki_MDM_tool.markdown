<h1>What is Munki?</h1>

Munki is a Walt Disney Animation Studios open source project.

Munki is a suite of tools that macOS administrators can use in conjunction 
with a webserver-based repository of packages and package metadata to manage 
software installs (and, in many cases, deletions) on macOS client workstations.

Munki can install software that has been packed in the Apple package format, 
as well as deployment packages and drag-and-drop disk images.Munki can also be 
set up to install Apple Software Updates from either Apple's or your own server.
Munki is used to manage software for tens of thousands of Macs in enterprises 
all around the world.

<h1>What Munki Does?</h1>
Munki is a collection of client-side utilities, most of which are built in Python. 
Munki can use any web server on the server side. On every platform, you can utilize 
any current web server that is available. On the web server, you do not need to install 
any Munki-specific application, but you must be capable of creating directories and files.
Munki can install software given as regular Apple packages - the same kind of products, 
disk images, and a variety of applications such as Adobe, Chrome, text editors, and a 
variety of other helpful programs. Munki has the ability to uninstall the program it has 
installed. Optional installs for devices allow you to control what is required for the computer, 
as well as update all software presently installed in Munki to the most recent version. 
Munki can also be set up to install Apple Software Updates.
 
<h1>What Munki cant do?</h1>

Many of the commercial mixtures for program arrangement in addtion supply mixtures for other 
surface of Mac management. Munki can't not. Munki focuses only on program deployment. If you need  
imaging, inventory, remote assistance, and preference management you will have to look for other useful programs.
