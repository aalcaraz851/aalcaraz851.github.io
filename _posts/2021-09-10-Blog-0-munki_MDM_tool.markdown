<h1>What is Munki?</h1>

Munki is a Walt Disney Animation Studios open source project.

Munki is a suite of tools that macOS administrators can use in conjunction 
with a webserver-based repository of packages and package metadata to manage 
software installs (and, in many cases, deletions) on macOS client workstations.

Munki can install software that has been packed in the Apple package format, 
as well as deployment packages and drag-and-drop disk images.Munki can also be 
set up to install Apple Software Updates from either Apple's or your own server.
Munki is used to manage software for tens of thousands of Macs in enterprises 
all around the world.
